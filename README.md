# RaycastEngine-Py

RaycastEngine-Py is a custom raycast engine programmed in python.
It uses pygame in order to render to a window.
It is simply a raycaster that renders its data as a 3D-looking display, supporting depth and colour.

Map data is stored in the src/map/map_data.raymap, as a 40x15 grid of keys:
  - 0 means blank
  - R means red square
  - G means green square
  - B means blue square
